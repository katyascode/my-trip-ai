# MyTrip AI
CMPT 363 Final Project: Team 5Ô∏è‚É£ (Lacey, Celvia, Shana, Katya)

# To run this project locally:

## (1) Clone the repository onto your device with: 

``` git clone https://github.com/katyascode/my-trip-ai```

## (2) Run the development server

First, open the project in an IDE or navigate to the directory in your terminal. Install all dependencies with ```npm install```.
If you do not have npm installed, you can do so through following the instructions on [this website](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm/).

Then, run ```npm run dev``` in the IDE console or your terminal to start your project on a local development server. 

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the app. For best resuls, open developer tools (usually through an "inspect" button) and view the app in mobile dimensions, as this is how we intended its use when developing our design. All data created through the app persists in your browser and is local to your device. 

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
